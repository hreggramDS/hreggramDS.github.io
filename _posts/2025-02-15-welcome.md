# Welcome!

I'm excited to launch this new portfolio site built with Jekyll and hosted on GitHub Pages. This site serves as a hub for my data science work, research projects, and technical writing.

## What You'll Find Here

### Projects
Detailed documentation of data science projects across various domains:
- **Bioinformatics**: Single-cell RNA sequencing analysis
- **Machine Learning**: Classification, clustering, and deep learning applications
- **Scientific Computing**: Computational physics and quantum systems
- **Data Engineering**: Pipeline development and infrastructure

### Pipelines & Workflows
Technical documentation for reproducible data analysis pipelines, including:
- Step-by-step methodologies
- Code examples and snippets
- Architecture diagrams
- Performance benchmarks

### Blog Posts
Technical tutorials, project deep-dives, and insights on:
- Data science methodologies
- Best practices and lessons learned
- Career development in data science
- Research updates and findings

### Publications
Academic papers from my Ph.D. research in physics and ongoing work in data science, covering topics like:
- Topological data analysis
- Many-body localization
- Quantum information theory
- Computational biology

## About This Site

This site is built using:
- **Jekyll**: Static site generator
- **GitHub Pages**: Free hosting and automatic deployment
- **Markdown**: Simple content creation
- **Liquid**: Templating for dynamic content

The structure is designed to scale from individual work to team-based research documentation, supporting:
- Reproducible research practices
- Clear technical documentation  
- Visual storytelling with figures and diagrams
- Easy navigation and discovery

## What's Next

I'll be regularly updating this site with:
- New project documentation
- Tutorial blog posts
- Pipeline guides
- Research updates

Check back often, or subscribe to the [RSS feed](/feed.xml) to stay updated!
