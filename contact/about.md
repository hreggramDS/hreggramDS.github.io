# About Me

Senior Data Scientist at Caterpillar, formerly at Boston Consulting Group. I finished my PhD at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 2022. My thesis applied techniques from topological data analytics to many-body localization, relativistic heavy-ion collisions, and quantum information theory. I also did a brief stint in topological semimetals and superconductivity.
